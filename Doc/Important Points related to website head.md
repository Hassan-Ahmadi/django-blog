# Important Points related to website header for seo optimization

## 1. Use one H1 header tag per page
Use only one H1 tag since using multiple H1 tag will make the search engine confuse.

## 2. Stick to the traditional header hierarchy
It’s important to use an easily understood hierarchy structure when applying header tags. That means you shouldn't jump from an H1 to an H4 header, for example. **H1 > H2 > H3 > ...**

## 3. Match search intent to headers
It’s important that the header matches the search intent of the page. When users type in a query or keyword in the search bar, there's specific information they want to see. Your content has to provide that information or Google won’t display it on Page 1.

## 4. Avoid keyword stuffing
Don’t use multiple keywords in a headline. A great way to avoid keyword stuffing is to use long-tail keywords that have lower search traffic but high purchase intent.

Don’t use H1 tags like “buy glass online: best online glasses.” That’s two keywords in one header tag, which signals to Google that the content on the page may not be relevant or provide much value. 

## 5. Use headers to break up text
When writing landing pages and blog posts, it's best to keep paragraphs short (roughly three lines of text). Keep H2 and H3 subheaders no longer than four paragraphs. 

## 6. Use secondary keywords in your subheaders
Conduct keyword research to determine the primary and secondary keywords for each page. These can be short or long (e.g., “Link building” or “What’s the best link building software”). Use the primary keyword in your H1 tag and spread out secondary keywords in H2 and H3 tags. This signals relevance to both Google and your potential visitors.
